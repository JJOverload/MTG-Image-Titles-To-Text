# MTG-Image-Titles-To-Text

if you don't have it already:
`pip install wheel`

then:
`pip install pandas`

`pip install Pyarrow`

Would need to install the "textdistance" package as well:
`pip install textdistance`

------------------------------------
**The Process Plan So Far**

Use this link: https://www.imagetotext.info/jpg-to-word

Then:
- Save output from link into a text file
- (Might need to remove noise somehow)
- Run autocorrector.py to have corrections in case missing minor spelling.
